# PGS: C++ HTTP Static File Server

PGS (Pp3ng's Server) is a C++-based, multi-threaded HTTP static file server designed for efficient performance. It uses epoll for I/O multiplexing and a thread pool for handling requests concurrently. PGS supports features like MIME type detection, directory indexing, and JSON-based configuration. It's lightweight design and focus on simplicity.

## Architecture Overview

The server is built with a modular architecture, separating concerns into distinct classes for better maintainability and extensibility.

### Core Components

1. **Server**: The main orchestrator that initializes and coordinates all components.
2. **Socket**: Handles low-level network operations.
3. **Router**: Manages request routing and static file serving.
4. **ThreadPool**: Manages worker threads for concurrent request processing.

### Utility Components

1. **Http**: Static utility class for HTTP protocol operations.
2. **Parser**: Configuration file parser using nlohmann/json.
3. **Config**: Structure for storing server configuration.

## Features

- ‚ú® Multi-threaded request handling
- üìÅ Static file serving
- ‚ö° Epoll-based I/O multiplexing
- üîß JSON-based configuration
- üéØ MIME type detection
- üöÄ Thread pool for efficient concurrency
- üìå Directory index support (serves index.html by default)

## Prerequisites

- C++17 or higher
- nlohmann/json library
- Linux environment (uses epoll)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Pp3ng/pgs.git

# Create build directory
cd pgs
make pgs
```

## Configuration

Create a `config.json` file in the server's root directory:

```json
{
  "port": 8080,
  "static_folder": "./static"
}
```

### Configuration Parameters

- `port`: Server listening port
- `static_folder`: Directory containing static files to serve

## Usage

```bash
# Start the server
./pgs
```

The server will:

1. Load configuration from config.json
2. Initialize the thread pool
3. Start listening on the configured port
4. Serve static files from the configured directory

## Design Decisions

### ThreadPool Implementation

- Uses a fixed number of worker threads (default: 4)
- Thread-safe queue for task management
- Condition variables for thread synchronization

### Socket Handling

- Non-blocking sockets with epoll
- SO_REUSEADDR and SO_REUSEPORT options enabled
- IPv4 support

### Router Features

- Automatic MIME type detection
- Directory index support
- 404 handling for non-existent files

### Supported MIME Types

- HTML (.html)
- CSS (.css)
- JavaScript (.js)
- Images (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif)
- Plain text (default)

## Error Handling

- Socket creation and binding failures
- Configuration file parsing errors
- File read/write errors
- Invalid request handling

## Performance Considerations

1. **Epoll Usage**

   - Event-driven I/O for better scalability
   - Efficient handling of multiple connections

2. **Thread Pool**

   - Prevents thread explosion
   - Reuses threads for better performance
   - Configurable thread count

3. **Static File Serving**
   - Efficient file reading
   - MIME type caching
   - Directory traversal prevention

### Response Codes

- 200: Successful file retrieval
- 404: File not found
- 500: Server error

## Safety and Security

- Directory traversal prevention
- Basic error handling
- Resource cleanup on shutdown

## Known Limitations

1. Only supports GET requests
2. No SSL/TLS support
3. Limited to static file serving
4. Linux-specific (uses epoll)

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add SSL/TLS support
- [ ] Implement caching mechanisms
- [ ] Add support for dynamic content
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility
- [ ] Configuration hot-reloading
- [ ] Request logging
- [ ] Better error reporting
- [ ] Performance metrics
